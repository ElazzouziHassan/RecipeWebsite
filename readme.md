# Project: Recipe Website

## **Tools** :

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 

## **Steps** :

### **Set Up Your Project :**

Create a new folder for your project on your computer. Inside this folder, create the following files:

index.html (the main webpage)
styles.css (for your custom CSS)
assets folder (for storing any images you want to use)

### **HTML Structure :**

In your index.html file, set up the basic HTML structure with the following sections:

- Header (navbar)
- Home
- Recipes
- Contact

### **Bootstrap Integration :**

Link to the Bootstrap CSS and JS files in the <head> of your HTML file. You can do this by adding the following lines:

```bash
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
```
```bash
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```


### **Navbar :**

Create a responsive navigation bar using Bootstrap's Navbar component. Customize it with links to Home, Recipes, and Contact.

### **Home Section :**

In the home section, you can have a welcoming message and a featured recipe or two. Use Bootstrap's components to style this section.

### **Recipes Section :**

Create a section where you can showcase your favorite recipes. Each recipe can be displayed as a card with an image, title, ingredients, and instructions. Use Bootstrap's grid system to arrange the recipe cards.

### **Contact Section :**

Include a contact form or provide your contact information, such as email and social media links. You can use Bootstrap's form components for this.

### **Custom CSS :**

Customize the styling of your website by adding rules to your styles.css file. Adjust fonts, colors, and layout as per your preferences.

### **Content and Images :**

Replace placeholder text and images with your own content. Make sure to save your recipe images in the images folder and reference them correctly in your HTML.

### **Testing :**

Test your website by opening the index.html file in your web browser. Ensure that it looks and functions as expected on various screen sizes.

### **Deployment :**

If you want to share your recipe website with others, you can host it on a web hosting service or a platform like GitHub Pages.
